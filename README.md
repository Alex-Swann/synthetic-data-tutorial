# Synthetic Data Workshop

## Usage

Synthetic data workshop - looks at steps to create a synthetic dataset for NHS A&amp;E data

## What is in this

### What we'll be doing

- Bayesian network
- Differential privacy
- What is synthetic data
- Three types of generating synthetic data
- Actual coding


- We're here to learn a certain form of synthetic data
- We are promoting the utility of the datasets but balacngin them with the privacy of who is in the dataset
- There are numerous ways to create synthetic data incliding random forests, RNNs, GANs, etc...
- We'll focus on this one particular dataset
- What it is, go through some of the UKAN 12 steps on the side, add bits to it
- Then try and talk about how we're going to do it
- Explain random choice in this
- Explain the second option
- Explain the third
- Look at the differences in variables
  
## Let's begin

### Random data
